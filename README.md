The 2D Helmholtz equation is a partial differential equation that describes phenomena such as wave propagation in 2-dimensional media (for example, acoustic waves, electromagnetic waves, or vibrations in membranes). The general form of the 2D Helmholtz equation is:

$$
\nabla^2 u(x, y) + k^2 u(x, y) = q(x, y)
$$

where:

- $\ nabla \$ is the Laplacian operator, which in 2D is expressed as:

$$
\nabla^2 = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}
$$

- \( u(x, y) \) is the unknown function that describes the field (for example, the amplitude of a wave) in the 2D domain.
- \( k \) is the wave number, related to the frequency of the wave and the medium in which it propagates.
- \( q(x, y) \) is a source function (which may be zero in some cases if there are no external sources in the system).

### In summary:
- The Helmholtz equation models how a function \( u(x, y) \) is distributed in space under the influence of a source \( q(x, y) \) and wave propagation in a medium with wave number \( k \).
- It is widely used in physics, engineering, and mathematics for wave problems in continuous media.

When there is no external source (\( q(x, y) = 0 \)), the equation reduces to the homogeneous Helmholtz equation:

$$
\nabla^2 u(x, y) + k^2 u(x, y) = 0
$$

This equation is key in solving wave propagation, vibration, and other related problems.
